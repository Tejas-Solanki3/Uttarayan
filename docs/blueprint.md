## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm yellow (#FFD700), evoking the solar theme and festive mood of Makar Sankranti.
- Background color: Desaturated warm yellow (#FAF0E6) to create a soft, inviting base that complements the primary color without overpowering it.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) as an analogous color that provides a refreshing contrast, reminiscent of the clear skies during the festival.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, precise feel, suitable for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ glassmorphism, gradients, glow effects, and soft shadows to create a high-end, ultra-modern, cinematic, futuristic, and festive interface.
- Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger (or Framer Motion where applicable) to create intense scroll-based animations, 3D visual depth, parallax, and smooth transitions, ensuring motion on every scroll interaction and fluid mobile animations.
- Integrate Lenis-style inertia scrolling for a smooth user experience.
